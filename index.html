    <button id="start-button">◉ Begin reading and listening</button>

    <p id="mood_1" class="fade-in">
      All trips start before they have begun and continue long after they have ended.
      Even the first sign of psychedelic awareness is the symptom of a subconscious event
      set in motion at an earlier point on a subtler sentient scale. It is the delayed grok
      that says alteration is already underway, like the ontic reverb the seasoned psychonaut
      feels holding a mushroom cap, a symbiotic moment charged with a dual tone of uncharted
      voyage and a peculiar consciousness of coming home.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      With this recognition I leave the hillside and turn homeward, finally in possession of
      the psychedelic key whose delicate biochemistry resonates far beyond the field in which
      it was born. Preparations must be made for such far-flung effects. My conscious intention
      for the day's trip was verbalized immediately upon waking, but the circuitous vector of
      most psychedelic events is established before dawn, in the dreaming bodies of trippers,
      and in the fruiting bodies of fungi. Only then does it wend its way along the serpentine
      path of the seekers' steps as they unwittingly trace through the dew-glazed grass the
      tapestry of subterranean filaments from which their trip key bloomed.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_2" class="fade-in">
      As I descend towards town, the crisp morning air of the autumn meadow invites me to
      rise above the cracked slate roofs and blackened chimney tops and cast off my socially
      sanctioned self-image, but it is within the sheltering walls of home where today's
      ritualistic centre of gravity resides. Disentangled for a time from the responsibilities
      of quotidian life, from all its attendant frustrations and petty demands, the familiarity
      of a quiet, empty house protects the solitary tripper, and allows one to trip in peace.
      It is usually a place in which to turn inward, but today I want awareness to have a
      freer reign in the hope that an encounter with these familiar spaces might reveal to me
      the most unconscious aspects of my domesticated psychology.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      A living past dwells in every house. Heirlooms have a psychic weight, wallpaper and
      shadows an emotional tone. Memories maintain their coloured imprint on things, like
      the lingering impressions of long-dead limbs on old sun-bleached furnishings. The
      virtuality of my residence gradually reveals itself as the mushroom begins to uncoil
      the presuming power of my senses. The mnemic stamp of previous dwelling places
      co-penetrate within a singular compressed time. These location-events disclose
      themselves as places I once tripped, having now been reconstituted in the
      present trip experience. I am reminded of the house I grew up in, my first universe,
      the earthly paradise of the maternal home in which I was born, long before my
      inescapable fate of being thrown into this world. This feeling of throwness gradually
      begins to expand and encircle me, and as I sit in silence, an immemorial domain seems
      to open up beneath my feet. It is another place I have called home, yet one which
      seems to lie beyond even my earliest memory. This feeling gives way to anticipation –
      of a great discovery (or re-discovery?) that is tinged with an almost cosmic sensation
      of otherness, and I realize that my voyage has only just begun.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_3" class="fade-in">
      As I lie in bed, I gaze at a painting on the wall of a Victorian fairground in a public
      square – a post-impressionist nocturne by some anonymous Parisian artist. The subject
      is a throng of working-class families gathered beneath a low canopy of trees. Some are
      Browse stalls of attractions, while others compete in various games of chance and
      skill – a brief respite perhaps from the daily factory grind. Despite their lot in life, the
      gathering evokes a carnival atmosphere, warmly illuminated by the dominant whirling
      lights of a carousel. The picture has followed me from home to home, becoming in the
      process timeworn and impoverished by the dulling effects of long association and
      familiarity. But today its pigments sparkle with opalescent tones and novel
      juxtapositions that seem distinct from the history of the forms they depict, as though they
      somehow operate outside of time.

    <p class="fade-in">
      The longer I stare at the details, the more fluid they become, until a strange phase
      transition appears to take place, transforming the picture into a <em>mis en scène</em>.
      The trees resemble the pearly underbelly of a pavilion roof, the leaves colored bunting
      flapping in the breeze. The outline of striped tents, light-bulb totems, and shooting
      galleries bulge beyond their brush-stroked boundaries. The life of the fairground is
      slowly revivified before me as the frame falls away to reveal an expanse of horse-drawn
      trailers and carriages parked haphazardly across a soaring grass bank. Dry ice gushes
      from the base of a piston arm as it leavens a ferris wheel of carnival-goers towards the
      sky. I watch in wonder as several human faces sheared by neon tracers ascend into the
      night, and for a brief lunatic moment I can read their minds, hear their screams, feel
      their urge to be freed from a fraying harness and a turgid plastic life and sent careening
      through the treetops to a better existence.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      Is this queer hallucination simply an expression of my own disenchantment with the world?
      I ask myself why suffering occurs, puzzle about the purpose of life, and question whether
      there is a larger, unseen order governing the universe, or simply chaos. Already it seems I
      have reached that psychedelic space where the whole depths of life are revealed within the
      scene before one's eyes, no matter how trivial it is usually considered to be. Regardless of
      context, everything is suddenly susceptible to some kind of metaphysical signification.
      Then it occurs to me: what if I make a concerted effort to delve deeper into something
      explicitly metaphysical – such as metaphysics itself?
    </p>

    <p id="mood_4" class="fade-in">
      It is said that philosophy, more than any other intellectual discipline, requires a radical
      reconfiguring of the mental grooves which make us always see things in the same way.
      With this in mind, I pick up <em>The Essence of Plato</em>, the book I have been reading
      over the last few nights, and look at the cover that first caught my eye in the second-hand
      bookshop – a watercolour rendition of the philosopher's famous Allegory of the Cave. As
      the story goes, a group of people have lived their entire lives chained up inside a cave,
      facing a wall, and projected on that wall are an endless parade of shadows. The shadows
      are cast by objects which, unbeknownst to the prisoners, are being passed in front of a
      fire behind them. Since the shadows are all they have ever known, the prisoners take
      them to be reality. They notice patterns in the way the shadows behave, and even give
      names to them, believing that they understand the truth. Then one day a prisoner is
      freed from the cave, experiences for the first time the real world above, and realizes that
      the things seen in the cave were merely shadows of real objects. The freeing of
      the prisoner is said to represent the promise of philosophy. In effect, by doing philosophy,
      one may see beyond the superficial everyday world and grasp the true nature of reality,
      in order to learn from it and align one's beliefs and actions accordingly.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      Plato believed that we recognise truth because the soul has seen it before. Beyond the
      reach of the senses lies a realm of eternal Ideas – archetypes known to the soul before
      birth.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      These Forms are said to ground all our knowledge. They give abstract terms like 'beauty',
      'justice', and 'virtue' a metaphysical pedigree. Each Form serves as the defining essence
      of its kind: a singular, unchanging standard against which all worldly instances are
      measured. Each Form also serves as a kind of metaphysical cause. A flower, for instance,
      is a flower because it participates in the Form of the Flower. Beautiful things are
      beautiful because they share in the Form of Beauty. In this way, Plato hoped to solve the
      problem of universals by proposing that things in the world resemble each other not by
      accident, but through their shared participation in a single, perfect original. The Forms
      explain not only how we think about things, but makes those things what they are.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_5" class="fade-in">
      I lie back on my bed and let the theory hover in my mind like a diagram drawn in vapor.
      Above me, the ceiling light begins to bloom. Its halo appears brighter than the filament
      inside the bulb, and extends beyond the immediate filigree molding to a larger circular
      pattern on the ceiling. The aura seems significant in a way I cannot quite put my finger
      on. These features appear vexed that they have only just caught my attention, and the
      labels I normally attach to them almost begin to elevate themselves beyond their proper
      rank in life. I am not seeing any old ceiling centerpiece, they protest. I am in fact
      looking at the Form of the Circle, made manifest in material form.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      Every room in the house has one of these ceiling rosettes. Every house on the street,
      probably. A recurring motif – like a secret glyph of residential geometry. Roundness
      upon roundness. My eyes find circles everywhere. They multiply: plates, pupils, clock
      faces, the sun. All seemingly participating in some shared roundness. This explains how
      things change and yet stay the same. But how do I, or anyone else for that matter,
      recognize circularity in the first place? No perfect circle has ever been seen in nature.
      The idea of circularity feels more like a concept that I've abstracted from many near-
      misses than something glimpsed in some prenatal cosmic syllabus. Why must Plato insist
      it must exist in a separate, eternal realm?
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      I close my eyes and try to picture the Form of Circle, as if it too were a particular
      thing. It is an impossible task, like imagining a color that doesn't exist. And yet,
      nebulously an image emerges from the roiling blackness that has a visionary quality to
      it, an almost Pythagorean prescience. Every point on its circumference appears exactly
      the same distance from its centre, a pure circularity that is in some sense vitreous or
      translucent, which seems to endow it with an implicate nature that can be present in
      not only this time and place, but other times and places also. Through the prism of its
      perfection there is a suggestion of mirrored depth, like a sphere whose interior, if compelled
      to do so, could migrate to its surface and graduate outwards indefinitely. Suddenly the
      circle's crystal radiance intensifies, and the disc fractures into multiple elliptical forms
      that ramify outwards in a conjunction of concentric circles, gradually declining in
      intensity as they glide across what is, by all appearances, an infinite two-dimensional
      plane.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      These copies aren't just approximations, but have an internal resemblance which
      participates in the original Form's pure quality. Even if all the circles in the world were
      suddenly destroyed – this dance of declension seems to say – I, the perfect Circle,
      would remain.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_6" class="fade-in">
      For Plato, the eternal, unchanging aspect of the Form of Circularity is what makes it a
      universal – the one true cause of the circularity that particular circular things have in
      common.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      Why then does the incidental and superfluous ornamentation above me seem to
      indignantly assert itself as the Circle of all circles made manifest in material form? I
      open my eyes and stare at it intently as it begins to resemble a perfect cordon
      surrounding a delicate work of ancient abstract art, like the floodlit perimeter of an
      inverse archaeological dig. I lie still for a while in order to fully absorb this strange
      upside-down world that has brought forth itself before me, at which point I notice that
      the filigree pattern is in fact a pendant of ivy leaves. The frail stems branch off from
      vines that reach out and twine around each other in a curvilinear continuum. I realize
      that of course ivy, being an evergreen plant, represents eternity, perennial life,
      immortality. Is this the subliminal origin of its spontaneously aroused sublimity? But
      then I remember that ivy berries are poisonous, and in certain parts of Britain, to bring
      the plant indoors is considered bad luck. Before I have even arrived at the terminus of
      this thought, each leaf seems to cringe arthritically, like a slowly tightening claw. The
      once-sublime vines almost visibly wilt, like the first sign of a cambial disease, and a
      visceral sinking sensation takes hold.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      An unusual discomfort compels me to sit up. Everything looks less clearly defined, a
      little less sure of itself, as though the objects in view are poised to act – or having acted,
      have abruptly come to a halt by the force of my arresting vision. On my bedside table
      is a copy of the William Burroughs novel <em>Naked Lunch</em>, and I pick it up
      only half-intentionally, as if to reinstate some sense of normalcy. However, by simply
      altering the position of my head, an altogether different kind of world suddenly appears.
      As I open the book, I am transfixed by the black and white photograph on the inside
      front cover of an elderly Burroughs. The picture must have been taken when the author
      was in his late seventies. A freshly ironed open-collar shirt and blazer do nothing to
      conceal the bony, hunched posture that lurches into the flash of the camera, yet his
      eyes gaze into the lens with a defiantly youthful curiosity. I begin to notice that it is
      not just the eyes alone that appear indifferent to the weariness of old age. The
      surrounding topography of lines and wrinkles are slowly relinquishing their depth
      before smoothing themselves away entirely before my own eyes, like the wind's
      inexorable whittling down of a rippled desert dune over weeks and months – only in
      this case accelerated like a time-lapse movie. An amateur interest in photographic
      techniques has taught me that one of the most important aspects of time-lapse
      photography is choosing how long to turn off the camera between frames. The period
      when the camera is not exposing frames is called the wait time, which can range from
      a quarter of a second to record a sequence of passing clouds, to one frame every fifteen
      minutes when capturing an acorn opening into a seedling. The present transfiguration
      has a wait time closer to a solar year, as though I am looking at a portrait-in-progress of
      a living statue continually enervated by the cycling seasons.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_7" class="fade-in">
      These fluid movements in age and demeanor seem punctuated by brief stochastic
      interludes harking back to specific moments in Burroughs' checkered biographical
      chronology, like mixed-up chapters of a life story, an animating visual equivalent of his
      literary cut-up technique. One time splice shows the face of uxoricide – Burroughs the
      killer of Joan Vollmer, his second wife, the victim of a drunken William Tell stunt. In
      another scene, a wide-eyed six-year-old tracks a strange apparition in the woods at
      nighttime. The succeeding image captures the moment in which an adolescent
      Burroughs realizes his homosexuality. In the next instant I see William the proud
      father, a pristine vision of paternalism, only for it to be twisted into the desperate stare of
      a depraved junky shorn of another fix. In many situations the average viewer of time-
      lapse cannot tell the direction in which time is moving; inexplicably, I am witnessing the
      same dilemma firsthand in what is somehow, at the same time, a clearly static image.
      I can no longer tell if the face is moving forward through the years or continually
      winding back the clock. The dark circles around the eye sockets, the receding hairline,
      the liver spots, furrows and shadows around the facial contours visibly retreat, only to
      advance and ingrain themselves more indelibly than before in the silent approach of
      death, as if the whole scene threatens to recapitulate the distilled memories of a
      lifetime, from the author's childhood to his twilight years in an intensifying closed loop
      that's spinning towards some sort of singularity in which all times and places might
      conceivably become one.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      I slam the book shut, canceling the possibility of an impending apocalypse: the
      threatened ingression of an eternal Form into the temporal world. I lie back down and
      close my eyes, only to see another transmogrifying Bill Burroughs, a living afterimage
      that, like its origin, drifts interminably from its former status as a still photo of a dead
      author in a rescued library book. I try to pacify my mind by remembering that pure
      Forms can never take material form, for that would be antithetical to their very premise.
      Forms stand outside human experience; they transcend the world – not only the
      experienced world, but the world itself.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_8" class="fade-in">
      Each flickering manifestation that appears in my mind's eye is unique unto itself, yet a
      likeness between them remains. But Plato said likeness needs a Form too – an eternal
      Likeness that all likenesses borrow from. But if the thing resembles the Form,
      doesn't the Form resemble the thing? So now we need a second Form to explain the
      resemblance between them. And then a third to explain that resemblance. And so on,
      ad infinitum. It's a hall of mirrors where each mirror needs a mirror to explain its
      reflection. The logic spirals – not upward into clarity, but outward into obscurity.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      This thought persuades me to open my eyes, condemning my priceless vision of absurdity
      to oblivion in an instant. I check the numbers on the clock on the bedside table. The
      contrast between real time and subjective time is striking. From the moment I became
      intrigued by the effluence of meaning emanating from the ceiling, barely five minutes have
      elapsed. But this, it turns out, is the least of my concerns. I am mentally thrown, indeed
      bewildered, by what has just occurred. Plato's Forms have deeply invaded my trip,
      implicating themselves in my reality as the cause of the properties and relations shared by
      like things, which up until now, I simply took for granted as being out there in the world.
      Yet the participation of these things has only ended up ceaselessly multiplying the Forms
      into even more Forms than there are things in the world. Now it seems as if the only way
      out of this infinite regress is to reduce the transcendent Forms to purely mental concepts,
      <em>thoughts in my head</em>, which by definition do not possess the properties that
      they name and so are not themselves members of an endless plurality.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_9" class="fade-in">
      To do this though, I must assume that my concepts are truly representative of things in
      the world. But how do I know for sure? Unless external things are also mental entities of
      some sort, how can I be certain that they relate at all to my concepts? The whole
      motivation for the Forms was to account for the shared qualities and relations between
      things in mind-independent reality, but this causal role has suddenly been lost, leaving
      nothing, seemingly, to replace it. What guarantee is there that my concepts unify things
      in the same way that anyone else's do? Indeed, what if all my concepts have ever done
      is masquerade as the causal forebears of common things in the world, imposing a
      perceptual sameness on them which <em>isn't actually there</em>?
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      The question hangs in the air threateningly, like a tear in the fabric of reality. I look up
      at the ceiling again, perhaps subconsciously seeking the last station of my previous sure
      existence. The Form of the Circle remains, only now it comes across as terribly
      portentous, perhaps even staged. The Forms were supposed to anchor the world. But
      now they are multiplying like spores in a petri dish – one for every shared trait, every
      resemblance, every property and predicate. The more I chase them, the less they
      explain. The end result is that the house I once called home is transforming into a dripping,
      lolling, surrealist landscape. A hitherto hackneyed and conventional domestic scene
      typically held at arm's length by my wandering mind is now a living composition,
      <em>leaning into me</em>. Against the carpet – now a shimmering protean lake of leaves
      and blossom – a series of everyday objects take up stylized positions on the tiled surface
      of the coffee table like mercurial performers in a carnival parade. Saucers turn into
      decorated floats, cups mount their elevated elliptical platforms and, as if silhouetted by
      spotlights, turn their most elaborately adorned profiles towards me. This impromptu
      performance, which alone is more than my fragile mind can parse, falls against a
      latticework of indefinable contrasts; a network of armchair dimensions which steadfastly
      refuse to correspond to the implicit standards that my body expects of them. 'My body?'
      I find myself wondering in delayed surprise. I hardly even recognize it as such. The
      outlines and surfaces of my limbs are visibly translucent. My arms and legs are breathing.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_10" class="fade-in">
      I desperately try to account for what is happening in terms that conform to my prevailing
      beliefs about mental and physical boundaries. Yet for the first time in my life, this
      question of it being either one way or the other no longer seems workable. It is as though
      the light of my consciousness is being shone through an endlessly fracturing conceptual
      prism in which the gap between self and other is no longer clear-cut and unvarying, but
      continually splitting into something new.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
      I try to assign the cause of these fluctuations to one world or the other. Inner or outer?
      Mind or matter? Yet at the centre of every seemingly reasonable position I discover a
      niggling seed of erasure that grows into its polar opposite and inverts the initial premise,
      indeed occludes the very thought-form that was its substratum, before somehow resolving
      to enroll and admit it within another, higher-order abstraction that tends towards unity –
      only for it to likewise negate itself completely. I watch in rapt awe as these competing
      narratives detach from my stream of ideation and take on a life of their own, wheeling and
      converging in my open mind's eye as a dyadic dance of ascending kaleidoscopic spirals,
      an exquisitely self-animated choreography of shape and color that is accelerating
      upwards, I realize, towards the oculus of a vast crystalline dome that's enveloping my
      awareness from above like a hyperbolic crown. With a gracefulness that is almost balletic,
      these spiraloid thoughtforms enter the geometric superstructure and pass through its
      open center to exit in unison, leaving only flickering tracers behind them, like comet tails
      cavorting in a solar wind.
    </p>

    <p id="mood_11" class="fade-in">
      Without warning, the vision collapses into infinitely graded sparkling jets of
      differentiated light, cued by a cloud of starlings outside that erupts from the treetops, like
      shrapnel from an explosion. The sound of their startled calls instills in me a palpable
      sensation of weightlessness, which for a brief eternity leaves everything substantial
      suspended in midair. Inevitably the moment passes, but in the days and weeks that
      follow, this sensation of levity remains with me, at once as a memory and an abiding
      presence, silently lining the patina of my soul.
